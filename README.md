# Antony Sequeira - Software Engineer
I have proven experience in developing products from concept to production.  
If you are a startup and need to go from zero to production, I can do it.

Xeduler is a personal solo project Iâ€™m currently working on.
It provides work scheduling automation for on demand workers.  
The backend is live on Google Cloud and the iOS app is available for users (working on getting the android app published).  
You can try the web app at [Xeduler](https://xeduler.web.app/) or use iOS
